		description: "In a dystopian future, the world is reeling from the effects of climate change. This period is also the harbinger of the Sangam – a cosmic convergence of realms. \nAs a monastery in a Himalayan village braces itself for an impending storm Krupa, a disciple of Sheersha yogis, finds out that hidden within an age-old manuscript lies the key to harmonising nature’s delicate balance. A quest to find it would be fraught with challenges and dangers. \nKrupa calls upon her brother Joash to help find the book. Living in a world of talking robots and flying cars, he is now a man of science. What would it take for Joash to leave London and embark on a treacherous journey back to the Himalayas? \nCan Joash harness the forgotten power of Sheersha yoga, face his karmic debts and stand against an unexpected malevolence threatening the world?",
