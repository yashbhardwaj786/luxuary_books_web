		description: "Kshamta is an author, poetess, dentist, teacher, mum, cook and a Tolkien fan. Karma Sagas - The Sangam is her first book and she intends to write at least a few more. Her interest in consciousness, sustainability and climate change has led her to explore science, spirituality and philosophy. It was all getting a bit too serious so she thought why not bring it all together into an entertaining story? \nWhen she is not busy figuring out treatment plans or lost in a fantasy land, she loves talking to her son about all things science. Born not too far from the Thar desert in North India, she now calls North Yorkshire her home. She blames the serene and picturesque surroundings to make her want to write â€“ a desire that had been peacefully sleeping since she was fourteen. But before that, she would make up stories and songs and even recite her poetry unabashedly at every opportunity.",
